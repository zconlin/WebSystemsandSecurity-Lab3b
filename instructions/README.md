# Lab 3B - PHP Part 2

## Overview

In the previous lab, we had you set up authentication for your application, but to really understand PHP, we're going to have you "transpile" your code from the JavaScript lab into PHP. This means looking at your JavaScript and trying to figure out how to do the same thing in PHP.

This lab builds off the previous labs (as do all of the labs), so make sure you organize your code well so you will be able to read and understand it again later. At the end of this lab, there should be almost no JavaScript in your project at all. (You should modify the JavaScript to live-capture the form data and submit it when the user adds a task. You may also keep any JavaScript to display completed tasks differently, i.e. linethrough or color change, if you used that previously. You should also keep any JavaScript to initialize any Date Picker if you used that previously. All other functionality should be implemented in PHP.)

> Note: When copying over your files from Lab 3A do not just copy over all the files. If you accidentally copy over the hidden .git folder the remote origin of your Lab 3B folder will change and all your work will be pushed to your Lab 3A repository and not your Lab 3B repository.

### Functionality

- Interact with a MariaDB database while creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks

#### Differences from Lab 2

- Using PHP instead of JavaScript
   - PHP is strictly server-side, which means all the database-accessing happens before a response is made from the server
   - The JavaScript in Labs 2 and 3 are strictly client-side, which means all of the database-accessing happens after the response from the server.
      - This means we can take one of two actions: use a local database (e.g. local storage), or make calls back to the server (e.g. API calls). We did the first one in lab 2, and we'll do the second one in lab 6.
- Using a database server instead of local storage
   - Because PHP runs server-side, any sorting that happens needs to be done before a response is sent from the server. This makes sorting a little more difficult in PHP than in JavaScript, so it is not required for this lab. We *would* do this by the SQL `ORDER BY` directive.
- Logging users in
   - If we didn't log users in, we wouldn't be able to easily and securely distinguish among users. We would have some kind of global task list for everyone, which sounds cool, but isn't very useful. (Twitch plays task list?)

### Assignments

Lab Write-Up Instructions are in the "Content" tab in Learning Suite.

## Instructions

### Step 1: UML

Create a UML diagram of the interaction described in the entire lab (CRUD functions and checking if the user is logged in) with swim lanes before you start coding. Try to get the hang of how everything is working together. You can always ask the TAs for help.

### Step 2: Database Setup

#### Production Environment

1. Using PHPMyAdmin on your Production Environment (`HTTP://<aws-ip-address>/phpmyadmin`), create a table called `'task'` in the `'lab_3'` database

   - Add the following fields:

      | Name      | Type      | Index     | ... | A_I | ... |
      | --------- | --------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
      | `id`      | `INT`     | `PRIMARY` | ... | ☒   | ... |
      | `user_id` | `INT`     |           | ... | ☐   | ... |
      | `text`    | `TEXT`    |           | ... | ☐   | ... |
      | `date`    | `DATE`    |           | ... | ☐   | ... |
      | `done`    | `BOOLEAN` |           | ... | ☐   | ... |

      > Note: The MariaDB DATE type is just a fancy text or varchar that gets validated upon submission.
   - If using Type `TEXT` gives you problems, you can use `VARCHAR` instead with an appropriately long max length value for a task’s `text` property. 

1. Using PHPMyAdmin or the MariaDB CLI, add a few tasks so you have some data to work with. Make sure the `user_id` field matches a user that already exists in your database.

#### Development Environment

1. Using PHPMyAdmin on your Development Environment ([`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)), follow the same steps as above

   > IMPORTANT: When stopping your docker containers, sometimes you'll want to delete the volume associated with `mariadb` (where your MariaDB database lives) using `docker-compose down -v` or `docker-compose down --volumes`. If you do this, all of the changes you made to your database will be gone. Adding the `--volumes` flag will remove your `user` table and your `task` table forever. It's not super hard to re-create them, but it might be annoying.

### Step 3: Transpile

> Because of the differences in where the code is run, and the difficulties in reproducing functionalities because of that, it becomes *very difficult* to get an automatic transpiler to convert from JavaScript to PHP. We want to copy over the general functionality, not all of the logic. DO NOT try and have your code automatically transpiled, *it will not work*.

1. Create

   - You should already have a form to create tasks from a previous lab. You will be handling the form with PHP instead of JS so make sure you remove any event listeners associated with this form.
   - If you've organized your `_action.php` files into an `actions` folder, add a new file called `create_action.php`, and set the `action` attribute of the `<form>` tag to reference it
   - Your action file needs to accomplish the following tasks:
     - Read the values passed from the form
     - Grab the id of the current user from the session (you should be saving the `user_id` to the session when a user logs in or registers)
     - Create a new task in the database using the form data and the user's id
     - Redirect back to `index.php` on success

2. Read

   - In your `index.php` file in the root of your project, do the following:
     - Connect to your MariaDB database and query for tasks that match the current user's `id` with the task's `user_id` field
     - As you've done in JavaScript, print a new task to the page for each result from the query
       > TIP: it may be helpful to define a function that accepts the details of a task and then prints them out, and call that for each task.

3. Update

   - If your checkbox isn't already in a form, wrap a `<form>` tag and a `<button type="submit">` tag around it
   - Create a new action file called `update_action.php`
   - Pass the task's `id` with the rest of the form when you submit it

      > TIP: You can accomplish this with a hidden `<input>` tag who's value is the tasks's `id`
      > TIP: Make sure to apply the correct CSS classes to the form to make the style consistent with Lab 2

   - Your action file needs to accomplish the following tasks:
     1. Read the values passed from the form
     2. Update the task in the database based on the passed values
     3. Redirect back to `index.php` if the update succeeds
    > HINT: Use a material icon for the button

4. Delete

   - Wrap your delete button in a `<form>` tag
     - If your delete button is an actual `<button>` tag, change the type to `type="submit"`
     - Otherwise, wrap the element that contains your delete button in a new `<button type="submit">` tag
     > TIP: Make sure to apply the correct CSS classes to the form to make the style consistent with Lab 2
   - Create a new action file called `delete_action.php`
   - As with `update_action.php`, pass the user's `id` with the rest of the form when you submit it
   - Your action file needs to accomplish the following tasks:
     1. Read the values passed from the form
     2. Delete the task from the database using the values you get from the `<form>`
     3. Redirect back to `index.php` if the delete succeeds

### Step 4: General Requirements

1. All your forms should utilize the appropriate HTTP method for its action ("post" or "get")

2. Any SQL statement that uses user-provided input should use Prepared Statements to interact with the database

3. Your website should look neat and tidy, with no text against the edge of the screen

   > HINT: You can use the `container` CSS class that comes with Bootstrap to automatically change the size of your content based on screen width!

4. Your `<nav>` element should have no other elements above it, span the entire width of the screen

5. When there is no user logged in, your home page should automatically re-direct you to the login screen

6. You should be able to switch back and forth between the login page and the register page when you're on it

7. When logged in, there should be a <kbd>Log Out</kbd> button on the `<nav>` bar in an appropriate location

8. The only `<script>` tag on your website should be the one that imports your CSS framework's JavaScript files.

# Tips

## How do I...?

Besides the resources listed at the beginning of this document, Google will be your best friend for this lab. For example you might search "PHP get form data from GET request", or "HTML hidden input", etc.

## var_dump()

In PHP there is a way to nicely print out any type of variable and it is var_dump(). This means you can give it an int, string, array, or object and it will print it out for you. This can be useful when working with results from your database.
